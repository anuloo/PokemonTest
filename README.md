# PokemonTest
Structural design pattern
The app is built with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is its structural design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups:

Models hold application data. They’re usually structs or simple classes.
Views display visual elements and controls on the screen. They’re typically subclasses of UIView.
View models transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. They’re usually classes, so they can be passed around as references.

Clean Architecture with 3 separated layers: data, domain, presentation(ui)
- Dagger Hilt
- Coroutine
- MVVM + Kotlin flow
- Jetpack compose
- Navigation component
